# Deadlock-Optimization-Resources
This Repository seeks to act similar to an [awesome-list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) where it is a list of resource and documentation on how to utilize and apply them
Please contribute as I am not all knowing

 # Ingame-Config-Adjustments
- [Dyson's Fps Config](https://gamebanana.com/mods/616141)
Worked well for me although does cause trooper gibs to be odd by default. It also is documented in Russian so that might be a bit confusing for tweaking values
- [Hanturaya's Fps Config](https://gamebanana.com/mods/609804)
Haven't tested
- [Maidehnless' Optimizationlock Config](https://gamebanana.com/mods/650519)
Haven't tested


# External-Adjustments
- [Optiscaler](https://github.com/OptiScaler/OptiScaler)
A means of modifying upscaling in deadlock. From minor testing I was able to force framegen (I think) but I have no idea how I did it 
- [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk)
This might help with windows users on older gpus as in some games there have been reported fps improvements from using dxvk, plus as I understand it the version of vulkan used by deadlock is out of date (not entirely sure though, although on my linux rig dx11 performs better)

# Todo 
- Verify that optiscaler can consistently force frame generation and destribute a config for optiscaler that does so
- Establish a standardized benchmark and test the three configs
